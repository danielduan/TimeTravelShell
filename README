We tried to make everything work and all the features should
be implemented. There are errors noted below. We are also unable to
make dist because of them so we tar'd it ourselves.

Implementation:
We first read in bytes one at a time, and then process it into a giant character array buffer. We check for any possible syntax errors, and if there are, we print out the error (without the line number). Next, the string buffer is passed into a function that will turn the string into a bunch of "tokens", each holding either an operator or a string. These are pushed into two different stacks, and processed the same way we would process math equations with stacks.

Known errors:
*precedence is not taken into account in certain && or ||
	against | or paranthesis
*in certain commands, parsing will introduce an unknown character
	at the end of the string
*line number is not printed upon errors
